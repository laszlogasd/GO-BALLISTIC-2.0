<!--  <description> 1.3 version description 
<![CDATA[ This mod adds several sets of ballistic weapons and drones to the game, including autocannons, gauss, coil guns and railguns, all with unique animations and sounds.

You can also use "ranged weapons" to try to deal a first strike against an enemy, shoot down an incoming threat, and do lots of other things ranged weapons are useful for.

If you want to see if a weapon is ranged, check its tip in the equipment tab.

Making this mod work perfectly with Captain's Edition is a bit of a pain, but it's doable. Despite what the load order in the CE thread says, you'll want to load the mods in this order:
	| GO BALLISTIC! CE Fixes
	| All CE resources, data and patches (in the order specified in the CE thread)
	| GO BALLISTIC! (this mod)
	| GO BALLISTIC! CE Content Patch
	V Any ship mods you are using

<![CDATA[ This mod adds 16 new weapons and 1 new toggle drone themed around out dated ballistic weaponry of the Federation during its foundation during the Federation-Mantis War.

This version is built for use with Multiverse 5.0+. The mod is a redevelopment and update of the original GO BALLISTIC!, a mod made by R4V3-0N with significant help from ChronoVortex. It features new art, sound effects, and a complete rebalance of the weapons and drones of the original. 
Reimagining the niche of these weapons using new Hyperspace functionality that did not exist at the time of the original mod and with a small team of friends.

This is the first release version of the mod and is subject to balance changes and suggestions and reports are encouraged!

Original weapon idea is from the Foundation of the Federation incomplete mod overhaul by WhaleCancer.
Spell checked by BetelgeuseBear and JerC.
